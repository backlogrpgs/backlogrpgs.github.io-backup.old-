I write reviews about older RPGs released on PC and on consoles. But instead of grading them on a numeric scale, I prefer to tell if they still have something to offer or if they aren’t worth the time. I do that because grading games from twenty years ago in a scale of 1 to 10 isn’t fair to the games or useful for players.

My reviews focus more on how enjoyable the gameplay is, and how interesting the story and characters are, the two backbones of any RPG (in my opinion). As such, I recommend games even if they have technological shortcomings related to graphics and sound. Most times I only give these aspects more thought if they were problematic or noteworthy at the time of the original release.

Backlog RPGs features mostly older RPGs from the time of the seventh console generation and earlier. But, from time to time, I also talk about more modern games. Sometimes I also talk about games from other genres and about stuff related to the games I review.

As for me, I started to game at a very young age during the early nineties when I got my first video game, a Mega Drive (also known as a Genesis in some backward parts of the planet). Growing up, I preferred to play JRPGs and the western styled CRPGs. Logically, I enjoy other genres of games, from the more action oriented to those focused on strategy and puzzle solving.

Like a lot of older gamers, I have a huge backlog of unplayed titles, so my goal is to play these games and to share my experiences with others.

Send me an email so we can talk more about older games or to request a specific one. Thanks for reading!
