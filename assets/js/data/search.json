It was developed by Richard Garriott and Kenneth W. Arnold while both attended the University of Texas. It was released in 1981 for the Apple II, soon receiving ports to other machines of the time, like Atari 8-bit computers, Commodore 64, DOS, and some japanese machines, like the FM Towns. In 1986 the game was recoded and released with a few improvements, like more city and castle maps and the addition of wandering monsters. This is the version sold by GOG and the one I played.This celebrated series consists of nine main titles, an online MMORPG (cleverly named Ultima Online) and a few spinoffs. Since Ultima 9’s poor reception in 1999, the series has been mostly forgotten by its owner, Electronic Arts. Interestingly, Ultima Online continues to be supported more than twenty years after its initial release, with official servers still running.The NarrativeYour adventure takes place in Sosaria, a land comprised of four continents, eight castles, 32 cities and 36 random generated dungeons. The world may look like another medieval fantasy setting, but it has some Sci-Fi elements thrown in. There are futuristic weapons and vehicles, space exploration, tie-fighters, hyperspace jumping and time travel.The game uses terms from older forms of English, like thy, thou and thee, and sometimes a “literary” style of writing. The manual does this as well and can make you chuckle a bit.The epic plot of Ultima 1 depicts the confront between the hero and the evil wizard Mondain. Sosaria is under his reign of fear, with monsters wandering through the continents and the common NPCs living in despair. The wizard cannot die thanks to a mystical gem that grants him immortality, and is your mission to find a way to kill him.It’s not an incredibly deep and complex story but it’s serviceable, like most narratives from the time.PresentationUltima was very innovative for its time, having an overworld with castles, cities and dungeons that can be freely explored. While on the overworld the game uses a top-down perspective, but goes full first-person view inside dungeons. It’s a nice mix that was later used in other titles, like the Phantasy Star series, from Sega.Still, it is more than 40 years old already. Logically it looks like a relic from a forgotten past. But to be fair, it was on the forefront of innovation, as it was one of the first commercial games to employ title based graphics.There are no music nor sound effects besides some speaker noises, so prepare your own soundtrack or podcast.MechanicsUltima can be a short game if you know what to do or play with a guide, as it doesn’t offer too much in relation to plot or gameplay. But it can be very rewarding if you explore the world without any help. There are some funny interactions with NPCs, a few secrets to uncover and, if you don’t compare it to modern titles, a big world full of cities to visit, dungeons to raid, princess to rescue, kings to steal from and monsters to kill. You can see that there was a lot detail and love put into this game, and I must commend its developers for their work.Crafting your CharacterAt the beginning you must create a character. First distribute some points between five attributes: wisdom, intelligence, strength, agility, charisma. Then choose a race: human, elf, dwarf or bobbit (yes, bobbit). Finally, pick a colorful name; a gender to roleplay and a profession.I named my bobbit thief Hundra, as a homage to the 1983 Italian-American-Spanish classic movie. After finishing your character, you can finally see Sosaria in its full glory. Beautiful!Starting the AdventureAs the game begins, you will find your character in huge map without any clue on what to do now. You can freely explore the region, but you can’t travel too far thanks to the monsters and other geographical barriers.From your starting point, there is a city and a castle nearby. If you go to the castle, you will meet its king, Lord British, ruler of Britannia. He is the alter ego of the game’s creator, Richard Garriott, who appears in mostly, if not all Ultima titles in this persona.Castles are very interesting in Ultima. You can “transact” with the king to exchange money for health or to receive quests that will send you to a sign-post somewhere in the world or to a dungeon to kill a monster. You can free a princess for some loot, drop stuff in a pond, or mass murder everyone (specially the jester). You can also steal armors, weapons and food.I was surprised when I discovered the game has a steal mechanic as it seems rather advanced for the time. Even if it’s very limited, as you can’t steal from people, only from specific places like stores and the king’s storage, it makes Ultima more distinguishable from its competitors. Just another in Sosaria A magnificent palace Take care to not be detected, though; otherwise the guards will mercilessly attack until you flee the castle or kill them all.The primary function of every city is to sell whatever your character needs on their adventure. Weapons, armor, food, spells, or a vehicle. Just don’t buy a horse, a cart, or a raft.You can also go to a pub and order a few drinks. Sometimes the bartander will tell you a rumor. Some are useful for finishing the game, others are useless, but don’t drink too much, or you will be “seduced” and lose half your money (we can agree that didn’t age well). Don&#39;t be like me, don&#39;t buy useless vehicles.When you leave the city your character will feel an insurmountable desire to eat and will start to consume all their food. It won’t happen while visiting cities or castles, only on the overworld and dungeons. If all the food is eaten, your character will die of instant starvation. But that won’t happen often, as you can buy food before leaving most cities or steal it from castles. In my opinion, this is a useless mechanic and only exists to force you to spend money.MagicDifferently from most RPGs, magic in Ultima functions as a consumable item. In other words, it’s not possible to learn magic, you must buy a spell as many times as you wish to cast it. You also need to buy them one by one, turning them into a huge hassle. Funnily enough there is a lore explanation to this limitation.In a time before the game started, magic was banned from Sosaria, resulting in the loss of its knowledge. At the present magic is being relearned, but there is no mage capable of memorizing it, so it’s necessary to buy them in bulks from special stores. I conclude the developers knew this was a problem and tried to transform it into a feature.My biggest question is: who produces these spells for wholesale? Does this person needs to buy other spells to create new ones? Is it a conglomerate or just a bunch of local producers? We may never discover, but I prefer to think there is a mega corporation on Sosaria mass-producing spells for stores and making a huge profit, all while the world is ending.Probably this is the same reason that all classes have access to most spells, except for a few that are exclusive to wizards.Dungeons, Combat and Character ProgressionUltima’s main quest revolves around obtaining four gems and a time machine to travel to the past and destroy Mondain, before he becomes immortal. To acquire the gems, you must go to a king and offer your services. He then will request that you kill a specific monster found only inside dungeons. Upon completing your assignment, he will reward you with a gem. Do it four times and you can start looking for a time machine.When you descend into a dungeon the game assumes uses a first-person view with monochromatic vectors, without any kind of texture. There you just fight, get coins and experience, open chests and coffins (yeah, coffins), eat to satisfy your craving for sustenance and search for stairs to reach the next level. There is no special treasures, secrets or encounters, so don’t lose your time looking for it.Since all dungeons have the same monsters and no special items to find, there is no incentive to explore them all, just pick one and complete all the necessary quests. You don’t also need to know their layout since you can buy some Ladder Up and Ladder Down spells. These spells create ladders for you to descend to the deeper levels and to go up until you reach the overworld, so don’t lose your time mapping these monster-infested places.When an enemy appears every time you do an action, it will attack or try to get closer, similar to most turn-based games. Besides running away, you can only attack, preferably with a ranged weapon or a spell to kill enemies before they reach you. If you die the game will start a resurrection process, but you will lose some items, coin and HP if it is successful. The minatour! Hello! In most RPGs you fight to gain more levels, increase attributes and find better items in order to explore new places and advance the story. yet in Ultima things don’t work exactly like that. Your character still gains levels by killing enemies, but that will only affect how many monsters appear on the overworld and the goods available in shops. It’s also necessary to be above a certain level to operate the time machine and finish the game.Besides completing the king’s quests and acquiring gold, you must kill monsters in order to increase your HP. It’s also possible to obtain HP by offering money to a king. That’s why gold is the most important resource in the game, as it is used to keep your character alive (by buying food and HP), and to increase their strength (by buying equipment and spells).I never grinded for HP before, but this title gave me this experience. It’s incredibly annoying to enter a dungeon only to increase your HP but end with less than you had initially. Imagine it happening two or three times. As I said before, HP can also be “bought” from kings, but since money is necessary, you still need to battle monsters to increase it.Naturally, you can always exploit the system by staying in the first two or three levels of a dungeon, where enemies give less damage and die from fewer attacks, making it easier to hoard money and HP.So, how do you increase your character’s attributes? By going to sign-posts.Except for strength, all attributes are increased by visiting a sign-post and interacting with it. You can’t use them two times in a roll, so prepare to go back and forth. It isn’t hard, just annoying. But to increase strength you must complete a quest for a king. Like with the sign-posts, you can repeatedly complete quests until you fully increase every stat. That’s a sign-post. Sigh.Space, the Final AnnoyanceAfter acquiring the four gems, it’s time to find the time machine. Any princess can say where you can find one, but they will only tell it to a level 8 character that is also an ace pilot, since princesses have standards. In order to become one, buy a space shuttle from the transport store and go to space. This is when my experience with Ultima 1 turned sour. Star Control IIThe game becomes a spaceship simulator, where you must travel between different sectors and destroy 20 enemy tie-fighters (yes, from Star Wars). Spaceships have two attributes: shield (its life) and fuel, necessary for every action you take, be it moving, shooting or aiming. If you’re out of it, you will get stuck and will spend the rest of your days drifting among the stars. To recover damaged shields and fuel, you must dock in space stations (first pay the 500 coins fee), what needs pixel-perfect precision, otherwise your vessel will bounce back and take damage.The space shooter segment is horrendous and tedious. It takes forever to move the marker to an enemy, and you also need pixel-perfect shots to destroy them. To find more foes, move from one space sector to another by performing a hyperspace jump. It’s annoying since it’s too long, but I like its animation, it cracks me up. Wow!After becoming an ace pilot, you can return to earth and go back to the normal gameplay loop to finish the game.Final ThoughtsThis is the second time I played Ultima and my opinion of it got better. I still dislike some of its design, like how HP and character progress work, but I must say I understand why it was a success at the time of its release. The game focuses in offering a somewhat open-worldesque experience on the charming world of Sosaria, where you can explore it, go on simple adventures or save the world finishing the main quest.In the end, Ultima 1 is a game almost 40 years old and don’t have much to offer in terms of writing or gameplay for today standards. Besides curiosity or nostalgia, it’s better to try other games, retro or not. In a time when most games have unnecessary remakes or remasters, it’s puzzling that Ultima lacks one.Final opinion: Not recommended, but worth a shot if you’re curious about the series beginnings. If you’re into DOSBox ports for phones, it may also be a good alternative to pass your time." }, { "title": "Eye of the Beholder - Let&#39;s play Mazes and Monsters", "url": "/posts/Eye-of-the-beholder/", "categories": "Pc", "tags": "1991, dungeons-&-dragons, dungeon-crawler, real-time", "date": "2022-03-07 00:02:00 -0300", "snippet": " IntroductionEye of the Beholder is a first-person dungeon crawler released in 1991 for MS-DOS. It was ported to the Amiga, the Sega CD and the SNES. The game uses the rules of Advanced Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 2nd Edition and was developed by Westwood Studios and published by TSR, the creators of the D&amp;amp;D before being acquired by Wizards of the Coast. As for Westwood Studios, besides creating many titles with the AD&amp;amp;D license, they are also the developers of Dune II and the creators of the Command and Conquer series.Part of a trilogy, Eye of the Beholder was followed by Eye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon and Eye of the Beholder III: Assault on Myth Drannor (which wasn’t developed by Westwood Studios).I played the GOG edition of the game. It comes with the Manual and a Clue Book, the former with 44 pages and the latter with 75. I miss the times when manuals had complementary content and good artwork, but I’m also glad that companion books aren’t required anymore because games became less cryptic.Besides these two books, the game should have come with a Data Sheet, since it’s the only place where you can find the keyboard commands. It seems the people at GOG thought players would only use their mouses. Fortunately, some kind users on the GOG forums scanned it for our benefit.The NarrativeTaking place in the Forgotten Realms world, the game starts with a cool introduction that shows a group of adventures being recruited by Piergeiron, chief lord of the city of Waterdeep, to descend into the sewers beneath the city and destroy the source of evil that resides there, the beholder Xanathar.After entering the dungeon, I thought there wouldn’t have any more plot development, but the game surprised me. There is a subplot about a group of dwarfs who wanted to reclaim the catacombs under the sewers, but after being ambushed by drows they need assistance to save their king and their prince. Nothing complex or that will cause important changes on the game. On the contrary, you can ignore the quest entirely or kill the prince.Like many RPGs of the time, the plot isn’t the game’s strongest aspect. It’s more like a story hook than a full narrative, but it serves its purpose of catching the players’ attention and imagination.PresentationThe game looks very good, with colorful and well-made sprites and backgrounds. Enemies look great and are taken directly from the Monster Manual (I think it was called Monstrous Manual at the time). Unfortunately, they suffer from a severe lack of animation, with a few frames to depict idle and attack positions.By the way, I love that party members have such silly faces that never fail to make me chuckle when I look at them.As for music, besides at the opening scene, there is none in the game. That could create an unnerving sensation while exploring unknown corridors of a subterranean maze, but you would need more ambient sounds to evoke this feeling.DOSBoxThere is a large discussion about how DOS games should look like, the difficulties raised by playing in LCD screens, the size of pixels, resolution and many more elements that would need a write-up from a person with better technical understanding of the situation. While you may think the subject isn’t worth your time, you certainly can’t play games that look like this: GOG&#39;s untampered installation GOG&#39;s untampered installation This is how everything looks like after installing the game with GOG GALAXY. Nowadays their distributions come with a GUI to configure the resolution and aspect ratio, so you can use that. Or you could do better and use a more up-to-date official instance of DOSBox, or try one of its forks. I used DOSBox-X during part of my play through and I was very happy with the results. I choose it because it has the “pixel-perfect” output. I also turned on the option to “Fit to aspect ratio”. It produced infinitely better results. Because a specific problem I will explain later, I played most of the game with the DOSBox-pixel-perfect distribution. Aside the pixel-perfect output, there isn’t anything special about this distribution, but it worked well enough.MechanicsAs an official AD&amp;amp;D product, Eye of the Beholder has the same rules of the pen and paper game. The manual does a good job explaining the mechanics, but they are only useful when creating a character, since the software does all the mathematics for you.Character CreationAt the beginning you must create four characters. You choose their gender, race, class, then roll their attributes, and finally pick a portrait and a name. Interestingly, you can freely change the value of your stats without restrictions. It’s possible to maximize your party, start with random attributes, or even copy the character sheets from your RPG group. The last option would make more sense in 1991 than nowadays, but who knows. Roll the dices!Your party can have up to six members. Some will offer join you, others must be resurrected first (remember to pick up the skeletons you find along the way). Interestingly, you can ditch your original party in favor of the later recruits. I would advise against it, since none of them are better than your original characters.After creating a party, you can finally start to explore the sewers of Waterdeep.ExplorationEye of the Beholder is a first-person dungeon crawler; therefore the gameplay consists of exploring the subterranean maze, killing enemies and acquiring new equipment and items. Initially I thought the game would become dull quickly, but the Waterdeep dungeon proved far more interesting than my early assumptions. It’s composed of twelve floors, and except for a few, they have unique designs and foes. The maps are big, especially if you consider the game doesn’t have an automap function.On the subterranean maze you will find illusory walls, concealed switches, hidden passages, portals that don’t need special items to work, portals that need special items to work, and lots of closed doors. Something that’s a highlight and you don’t see that often on these old games is the possibility to open doors by forcing or by lock picking them. Your party will also face traps like pits, traps that throw darts, and traps that cast spells. Finally, if exploring and discovering secrets is your thing, each level has a hidden quest to be completed.Many walls have runes with messages to the player, some useful, some cryptic, and I bet that a few are useless. An interesting detail is that some of them can only be read if you have specific races on your party. Level 4 Level 7 Level 9 Level 11 Lastly, while exploring your party will become hungry and their food bar will start to deplete. When it finally reaches zero, characters will lose 1 HP every 24 hours. They also won’t be able to memorize or pray for spells, so check this status regularly.AutomapThe game lacks an automap, so you will need to make your own maps like it’s 1980 or have the Clue book, which has the maps of all floors, the location of all items, secret quests and a few more tips. Or you could use the program “The All-Seeing Eye” (ASE), which is a great companion software. It will automap while you explore, showing items, enemies, secret walls, traps and tips for all floors. It also has a few other useful functions, like show you all the entire map, edit the party members, and more. The All-Seeing EyeIt’s a great program but I couldn’t make it work with DOSBox-X. I tried different configurations, I tried to replace the GOG DOSBox, all to no avail. So, I changed to DOSBox-pixel-perfect distribution and it worked flawlessly. I still prefer DOSBox-X tough.Battle SystemBattles happen in real time, so be prepared to strike any enemies as you see them and to be attacked at any moment. As your characters are positioned in rows, each containing two party members, their placement will limit their offensive options. Only the ones on the front row can attack with melee weapons, while those on the back rows can only attack with ranged weapons and spells.Golem punch!For each character, the game displays their name, portrait and current HP. It will also show their primary and secondary hands. There you can equip weapons, shields, potions, a spellbook or a holy symbol. You can also see their position on the party’s formation. It’s possible to freely change that while exploring or fighting. It’s a useful feature when a front character gets paralyzed, is too damaged or dies.Interestingly, the game doesn’t reset enemies after they disappear, neither they have a way to heal themselves. So, it’s possible to exchange a few blows against a monster, run away to recover, then come back to continue the fight without any negative repercussion. You can also keep your distance by attacking with spells or throwing weapons while stepping to the sides or back. Another nice strategy is to hit enemies from the side or from behind before they can react for some sneak damage. A kobold attacks!Like on the pen and paper RPG, clerics must pray for spells and wizards need to memorize theirs. During my play through, I didn’t feel that I needed a mage in my party. They can be very useful, but it’s not a class that you will miss out. But I was glad I had a cleric. Even if spells that recover HP aren’t essential to most battles, clerics can cure poisoning and paralysis. They can also create food, making rations unnecessary.To attack you must right-click on the hand that you wish the character to use. If it has a weapon, the character will use it. If it has a spellbook or a holy symbol, a menu will open up so you can choose a spell. It seems fine early on, but as battles become longer, its repetitiveness will start to weigh on you.Excluding enemies that cause negative statuses or that can one hit a character, most fights consists of you and your enemy hitting each other back and forth. There’s no strategy involved, what makes killing monsters a lot less satisfying. Another problem is that you must manage the actions of six characters in real time, without the option to automate a few of them, fighting enemies quickly becomes tiresome and boring. It’s possible to use the keyboard instead of the mouse, but I didn’t feel it was an improvement. Battles end up hectic when facing strong opponents, but not in a fun and rewarding manner. Everything becomes worse when enemies flank your party or hit you from behind without any warning.Final ThoughtsI found Eye of the Beholder more enjoyable than I initially thought it would be. I liked the exploration, the hidden secrets, and the uneasy feeling when your party descends into an unknown lower level. Having said that, the combat detracts from the experience, due to a cumbersome interface and awful flow. As that is an important aspect in a dungeon crawler, it’s hard to recommend this game.It’s an overall fun adventure, marred by its fights. Probably at the time it was a fun way to spend time between weekly D&amp;amp;D sessions. It’s also relatively short if you don’t make your own maps. So if you don’t mind the annoying combat and has a passion for dungeon crawlers, go get it. It’s available on GOG on their “Forgotten Realms: The Archives—Collection One” pack, alongside the other two Eye of the Beholder games.Final opinion: Not recommend thanks to its combat. If you don’t find it too annoying, it’s a good game." }, { "title": "Peret em Heru For the Prisoners", "url": "/posts/peretemheru/", "categories": "Pc", "tags": "1996, rpg-maker, egypt, independent, horror", "date": "2022-02-10 17:32:00 -0300", "snippet": " IntroductionHere’s a short review for a fun little game. Peret em Heru: for the prisoners (or Shūjin e no Pert-em-Hru 囚人へのペル・エム・フル) is an independent game released on May 31, 1998. It was developed on RPG Maker 98 Dante II by Makoto Yaotani, under the pseudonym Makoto Serise, with music composed by Kei Mizuho. According to Wikipedia1, it won the Platinum Award for the August rendition of the “Internet Contest Park”, held by ASCII on a monthly basis from July 1998 to June 2002.On September 26, 2014, the fan translation group Memories of Fear released an English translation for the game. You can download both on their website2.The Narrative A surprisingly faithful rendition of Giza&#39;s inner chambersThe game starts with the discovery of subterranean structures on the Great Pyramid of Giza, tomb of pharaoh Khufu, by Professor Tsuchida and his assistant, Koji Kuroe. The men try to open the door of the hidden chambers but are unable to move it. They ask the help of a hired miner, who starts to push the door. As he was almost opening it a trap decapitates him, leaving both survivors astonished.Not desiring to wait and lose his finding, the Professor starts to ponder on what to do if there are more traps along the way&amp;gt; He thinks of a wicked plan: use some tourists as human shields. As he goes back to the entrance of the pyramid, he encounters a group of Japanese visitors and invites them to help on his groundbreaking excavation.The group is composed of high school students Ayuto Asaki (our main character), Kyosuke Hino, Nei Ichikawa and Yoko Nogisaka (sometimes called Yoyo, a funny typo), the problem child Rin Tsukihara, wanna be Snorlax Mitsuru Koeiji, another high school student named Saori Shinoda, the tourist guide Sae Otogi and the reporter Soji Mizumi.The group than heads to the subterranean entrance to uncover the secrets of pharaoh Khufu’s tomb. The character roster.You start the game with 11 characters. As the story progresses, some will die after being judged by the mystical powers inside the pyramid. Deaths are brutal with some cool pixel gore, and affect the story’s outcome in some well thought ways. But if you’re able to save your companions, you will see a happier ending.For a short game, there is a lot going on. You will find drug trafficking, a serial rapist, a love square (there are four people involved), greed, and jealousy. The further the group explore the pyramid, the more you will know about them. Some are sympathetic, others are just terrible human beings. Ultimately, as their past sins are revealed, they will be judged. If they survive the endeavor, some characters will try to find atonement for their past actions, thinking on improving themselves going forward.Even if the plot is a tad formulaic, I enjoyed knowing more about each character’s true self. The game surely goes beyond the themes you would normally see on commercial titles of the time, so congratulations to the developers.PresentationAfter starting the game, my first impression is that I was playing something on a PC-98 or a PC Engine/Turbografx-16. Graphics are what you expect from an RPG Maker game of the time, however the artwork for characters, enemies and for a some secenes brings some personality to the title. The few songs available are fine, but nothing that you will be listening after finishing your playthrough. Some creep scene at the beginning Relaxing dialogue Fighting a common enemy. Fighting a boss MechanicsSince Peret em Heru was made on the RPG Maker engine, it behaves like a traditional JRPG, packed with random encounters and turn-based fights. But the game’s creators, inspired by the original Corpse Party, decided to implement puzzle solving to spice things up.Characters’ deaths work as little puzzles which you must solve to save your companions. Failing to perform the right actions or use the appropriate item will result in their demise. It’s a mechanic reminiscent of adventure games that gives more depth and personality to what would be a run-of-the-mill JRPG.But be aware, some deaths happen so seamlessly that you will only know about it when one of your companions point out someone is missing. So save scum with care!To see how many characters are alive just go to the menu. Cool pixel goreChoosing which companions to save is important since it reflects on who can be recruited to your active party. On that aspect, besides the main character, you can only pick one more person to explore the pyramid. Most characters can only be recruited after they survive the pharaoh’s judgment. This limitation adds a little layer of strategy during the play through.As for battles, they are your standard JRPG fare. Attack, heal and use special abilities until enemies are dead. There is no deeper thought involved, just brute force them.Final ThoughtsI enjoyed this little game. It has a contemporary setting, a good story with some heavy themes and characters that are very interesting. Unfortunately, besides the puzzles the gameplay doesn’t offer anything out of the ordinary. But that shouldn’t be a problem thanks to the game’s short length.I think it’s a very good game, even more if you don’t want to commit to something longer or just need a quick RPG fix.For those who enjoyed this little game, apparently there is a remake in the works. You can see more here.Final opinion: Recommend for its length, fun puzzles, good story and interesting characters. It’s also free.

It has a dating sim interface, ludicrous worldbuilding, anime-style underage cute girls, some scenes of pure fan service and a turn-based battle system. If you’re on this type of thing, continue on reading, if not, you’ve been warned.The game was originally released on the PlayStation Vita in October 2013, and later on PCs in January 2015. It’s a remake of Hyperdimension Neptunia, a PlayStation 3 exclusive from 2010. While previously developed by Idea Factory and Compile Heart, Neptunia’s remakes were created by Felistella. From what I’ve found, Re;Birth1’s story is somewhat different from the original, with only a few central plot points preserved. It also incorporates mechanics from its sequels, making it a nice starting point for new players.The Narrative The ludicrous world of GameindustriBased on real life events, the game takes place in Gameindustri, a dimension comprised of five floating islands, each protected by a goddess: Planeptune, protected by Neptune (or Purple Heart); Lastation, protected by Noir (or Black Heart); Leanbox, protected by Vert (or Green Heart); and Lowee, protected by Blanc (or White Heart). The fifth land is named Celestia and is where the goddesses reside. The four are known as Console Patron Units, or CPUs for short. Besides taking care of their nation and its people, the four keep fighting each other for the control of Gameindustri, a conflict called “The Console War”.The game starts amidst a battle between the four goddesses when a mysterious voice says they should join forces against one of them to break their stalemate. Purple Heart is chosen as the target and is defeated by the others. Yes, they never thought about it and yes, they aren’t very bright.Neptune falls from Celestia and crash-lands in Planeptune, transforming into a young girl on her way down. While unconscious, she’s contacted by a sentient book that registers the history of Gameindustri called Histoire (in French), who asks for her help. As their chat abruptly ends, the now amnesic Neptune is rescued by a girl named Compa.After receiving fan-service medical aid, Neptune and Compa go investigate the game’s first dungeon. During the boss fight, Neptune transforms into a more powerful form and beats the monster. For their victory, they find a Key Fragment. Histoire explains that she’s trapped and needs three more of these items to be released. In exchange, she will help Neptune to recover her lost memories.Before looking for the next Key Fragment, the girls take a job at the local guild to investigate a cave infested by monsters. While exploring the place they meet their third party member, a girl called IF. The three are attacked by the mysterious character from the game’s introduction, who wishes to absorb Neptune’s power. After the fight, we discover her name is Arfoire (also in French) and she’s the game’s true villain.From now on Neptune must travel to the other lands to recover the rest of the Key Shards, retrieve her memories and recruit her fellow goddesses (and a legion of girls) to beat Arfoire and save all Gameindustri.That was a lot to unpack.The story isn’t long, as it’s divided in only eight medium-sized chapters. Most of them have Neptune visiting a different nation of Gameindustri and helping the local CPU deal with Arfoire’s newest plan. The story also lacks depth, as most of its themes, like friendship, going forward, being who you really are, don’t have any interesting nor original development.But let’s be real, no one will think about playing a game called Hyperdimension Neptunia; Rebirth1 for its gripping plot. Probably its biggest attraction on the narrative front is its main characters. But not because they’re well-developed and have a memorable journey, but because they’re cute, dorky, and sometimes, genuinely funny. I love them. Hentai joke The dialogue is comprised most of jokes, quips and self-referential humor, with the occasional information dump. It gave me some chuckles, but don’t expect to enjoy it if you’re not into anime-like writing. If you are, the game is a lot of fun, with lots and lots of lines of dialogue.On a positive note, I enjoyed the worldbuilding. Transforming the real-world console wars into a fight between deities is a ludicrous yet fun concept that you usually only see in Japanese media. If you don’t know much about the story of video games, a console war is the struggle for market dominance between platform makers. The game depicts past and present companies as the different nations of Gameindustri and its CPUs as their consoles: Planeptune: represents Sega. Lastation: represents Sony. Leanbox: represents Microsoft. Lowee: represents Nintendo.Interestingly, Neptune’s name comes from an unreleased Sega console, the Sega’s Neptune. You can read more about it here.PresentationNeptunia’s first adventure on the PC market isn’t very impressive from a visual standpoint. As standard for JRPGs since the PlayStation 2 era, story segments are presented similarly to an Adventure/Dating Sim game, with just artwork of the characters involved in the scene, a text box and the dubbed dialogues. Dungeons and other areas with enemies feature scenarios and characters modeled in three dimensions. They aren’t as attractive as their two-dimensional counterparts, and are more akin to a middle-of-the-road PlayStation 3 game.The artwork from story segments is beautiful, even if it doesn’t look as sharp as I would like. Something that adds a lot of charm to these moments is how the characters’ portraits move. They breathe, their hair seems as if being blown by wind, their lips move while speaking, and sometimes their face shows different types of emotion. An important conversationThe fan-service artwork spread throughout the game is very good, if you are a person of culture.There is a decent variation of dungeon to explore, like volcanic bases, mountain passes, abandoned ruins, factories, etc. Nonetheless they all are bland and uninteresting. They aren’t ugly, just there is nothing noteworthy about them. No special set piece or intricate design, neither intriguing puzzles.A nice touch that you rarely see on turn-based RPGs is the presence of enemies on the screen. They will be there no matter how big they are. There is some variation to their designs, ranging from joke monsters, generic 3d robots and some creative ones.As for characters’ models, they’re well made and are very cute. Thankfully, they don’t have that lifeless doll expression some 3d anime have. If you aren’t satisfied with your party’s looks, there are a lot of clothes and accessories to customize its appearance.While exploring dungeons and similar locations, only the first character from your party will appear on-screen, but if you buy the Tag Along DLC you can have the other two members follow you. That’s a shameful scam. Even if it’s cheap, it should have been a free update, not a paid DLC. From reviews on Steam, it can be pretty buggy, with characters frequently getting stuck around corners and jumping like there is no tomorrow.Unfortunately, everything during the 3d segments looks blurred, and there are no video options to solve it. But if you’re more demanding with your graphics and want them crisp, fear not. There is a mod called Neptastic Mod that dramatically improves the visuals (I’m not exaggerating). Don’t play the game without it! Mod off Mod on Mod off Mod on Mod off Mod on Thanks to the mod, you can even play in 4K resolution (what I used while taking the screenshots). It also works on Re;Birth2 and Re;Birth3. Please don’t use Hyperresolution Neptunia, as it doesn’t work very well anymore and has less options than Neptastic.You can choose between Japanese and English dubs, but per tradition I played with the Japanese one. It sounds very good and the actresses match their roles very well.The soundtrack fits the lighthearted tone of the game. However, I didn’t care for it while doing my playthrough. No song caught my attention and had me wanting to go back or to prolong my stay just to keep hearing it. I didn’t think the songs were terrible or anything, just serviceable. But then I listened to them without playing, and I’m sorry for those who enjoy the soundtrack, but I think it’s awful. The game genuinely deserved a better, more varied set of songs. However, if you liked it, the PC has a paid DLC that comes with 29 tracks. I believe it’s the complete soundtrack, but it may be missing a song or two.MechanicsAgain, the game is very similar to how JRPGs play since the PlayStation 2 era: no overworld to traverse or roam, only a hub screen where you can choose what to do and where to go. By selecting cities you can shop, listen to the soundtrack and look at artwork at the Museum, take part in special events or in compulsory story scenes, and use the guild. In the guild it’s possible to accept missions that revolve around defeating enemies or bringing back the items they leave for rewards. Some assignments are also necessary to progress the game’s plot. More options will be available later on, like the Colosseum, where you can fight high level enemies, and the CPUs’ blogs.When you enter a dungeon or similar area, you will be able to freely roam through it. It’s possible to jump to reach some higher places, emit a Treasure Search wave to find invisible treasures, and do an attack. If you strike an enemy, you will gain the initiative in battle (the game calls it Symbol Attack). If they touch you first, they will gain the initiative (a Surprise Attack).Battle SystemThe battle system isn’t deep in the sense that it has a lot of intricacies, but has many different and useful parts that make fighting a fun experience. The three types of Combo SkillsThe game employs a turn-based battle system in which your three active party members can freely move throughout the battlefield’s map. As all forms of attack have an area of effect, movement adds a strategic element to every fight, since you need to think where your character should be to inflict more damage and receive less. You can keep an eye on the attack order by looking at the upper right corner of the screen.Before starting a battle, it’s advisable to set up your Combo Skills and Ex Finishers on the Commands menu. Combo skills are how the game calls your common attacks, while Ex Finishers are special attacks that you can utilize at the end of your attack string if your EXE Drive Gauge is filed up. There are three types of Combo Skills, each with their unique effect: Rush: more hits but deals less damage; useful to increase the EXE Drive Gauge faster. Power: less hits but deals more damage to the adversary’s HP. Break: deals less damage to HP but depletes the enemies Guard Points bar faster, speeding Guard Breaks. While that status lasts, you will inflict more damage to your foes. Managing attacksDuring a standard turn, you can choose three moves for each type of combo skill, and then four more finishers. In other words, each character can have up to 13 distinct attacks available. So if you choose the Attack option, you will: hit the enemy with a physical attack; then you must choose between a Rush, Power or Break attack repeat the last step two more times; unleash your Ex Finisher.It may appear long and cumbersome to keep navigating so many menus, but as each Combo Skill is mapped to a specific button it’s easy to deliver a fast barrage of attacks.As characters level up, they will gain more Combo Skills. Some are just stronger than older ones, others have unique effects or properties. It’s up to you to experiment and choose the most appropriate.There are two more forms of attacks: SP Skills, your run of the mill, attack, heal and support abilities. There are also Exe Drive Skills, special skills that requires that you fill something called the EXE Drive Gauge.The Exe Drive GaugeFilling the Exe Drive Gauge is necessary to use Ex Finishers and Exe Drive Skills. It will slowly build up every time you attack or is attacked. However, it’s possible to speed it up a lot by using Rush attacks. If the meter is over a set level you will be able to utilize EX Finishers as the last action of a combo. It also unlocks the use of Exe Drive Skills. These skills are stronger than SP Skills but they will deplete the Exe Drive Gauge, so they’re better reserved for stronger enemies. Like Combo Skills, Ex Finishers and Exe Drive Skills are usually acquired by gaining levels.Hard Drive DivinityAn exclusive feature of the CPUs is their ability to sacrifice 20% of their max SP to transform into a more powerful form called Hard Drive Divinity (HDD). This is the same form they had during their fight in the beginning of the game. Unfortunately, it’s just an elaborate status boost. Nonetheless, they’re very good for tougher battles.Lily System This mechanic allows players to pair an active party member with an idle character. Partnered characters will gain new passive abilities (more EXP, less waiting time between turns, less SP for skills, etc.), new Ex Finishers and new Exe Drive Skills. But these skills are acquired only when their level of affinity, or Lily Rank, reaches a certain level. The more battles two characters fight teamed up, the more their Lily Rank increases. Another benefit is being able to swap between paired characters throughout combat. It’s like having a backup team in case your party is about to die.Other stuffRemake SystemIf you like crafting, the Remake System will be a lot of fun for you. By utilizing different Plans it’s possible to modify certain elements from the game (like EXP received, jump height, how strong enemies are, etc.) or add new items, equipment, monsters and even dungeons.To create a Plan, first it’s necessary to acquire Plan itself from enemies or on special events. Next, harvest the required materials. Lastly, if you have enough “memory available”, then you can finally develop it. You don’t need to use the Remake System to finish the main story, but it adds a good ammount of optional content to give you more gameplay time. Exploring extra dungeons and acquiring new items and equipment may be a good distraction if you ever need to grind.DLCUnfortunately, the game has a lot of content locked behind paid DLC (I think it’s a lot, I don’t have a high tolerance for this type of situation). Level caps, additional characters, new dungeons, a film theater function, the option to have more than one character on the map, and the list goes on. It leaves a sour taste when you need to pay more for so little content.Final ThoughtsI enjoyed the game, yet it’s hard to recommend it for everyone. The setting is great, however it’s a novelty that won’t carry you for long. The story is simple and won’t surprise you in any way (just another “let’s save the world”). For those that dislike anime tropes, characters may seem annoying or cliché, but they have some charm and I won’t lie that I loved some of these dorky people from Gameindustri. The four CPUs of GameindustriThere are some complaints about how the fan service and the character designs are sexist (which they are). Despite sexism being a valid critique against Japanese media as a whole, the game has many redeeming aspects, like how its world is governed by four women, a rarely seen all-female main cast, main characters have different personalities, passions and hobbies (none that involves a man). Either way, I think the game has considerably more to offer than just fan service and deserves a fair chance.On the technical front, I enjoyed how battles flowed but was unsatisfied by the lack of exploration. I saw some complaints about the game being grindy in some sections, but I never felt it (maybe I fought too much). If you enjoyed the battle system, there are a lot of optional dungeons to complete (unfortunately some are paid DLC) and the Colosseum, where you can fight to your heart’s content.In the end, I wouldn’t recommend this game if you can’t stand anime tropes and simple writing. I wouldn’t also recommend it if you’re against buying products from companies that release predatory DLC. But if you are into weird Japanese curiosities and enjoy JRPGs and anime, the game is for you.Final opinion: Recommend only for anime fans, people who like silly and light-toned stories, and logically, for people of culture." }, { "title": "Cthulhu Saves the World - a fun little adventure", "url": "/posts/Cthulhu-Saves-the-World-a-fun-little-adventure/", "categories": "Pc", "tags": "2010, JRPG, humor", "date": "2022-01-03 11:00:00 -0300", "snippet": " IntroductionBefore starting: If the game crashes during the first cutscene, go to the end of the review for a solution1.Who would have imagined that mixing 16-bit JRPG mechanics and aesthetics, self-referential humor, fourth wall breaking and a Great Old One from Lovecraftian horror would be a recipe for success? Robert Boyd and William Stiernberg, founders of Zeboyd Games, thought it was a great concept and the result is Cthulhu Saves the World, a more modern take on JRPGs that doesn’t take itself seriously.The game was originally released as a digital title for the Xbox 360 in December 2010. Not long after, the developers ran a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds to port it to PC and to add some cut content. The campaign was very successful, and the enhanced port was released on Steam in July 2011. It is called Cthulhu Saves the World: Super Hyper Enhanced Championship Edition Alpha Diamond DX Plus Alpha FES HD Premium Enhanced Game of the Year Collector’s Edition. The new content and improvements also came to the Xbox 360 through an update.Some of the most interesting additions were the Cthulhu’s Angels game mode, a director’s commentary, character art and expanded dialogues.The NarrativeRight at the start it’s easy to understand that the game doesn’t take itself seriously and wants to make you laugh. The plot, characters, NPCs, dialogues, the descriptions of objects (like bookshelves and tombstones) and even monsters, everything has a humorous nature, so remember that going forward.The story begins with the evil protagonist, Cthulhu, awakening from its ancient slumber to destroy the world. Luckily, a “mysterious stranger” seals the Great Old One’s powers. The Narrator then informs us that only by becoming a true hero Cthulhu will break the spell and recover its powers. Cthulhu eavesdrops the explanation and decides to do exactly that to undo the spell and destroy the world. The contradiction is intended and is part of the title’s humor. Breaking the fourth wall.Most of the game’s story is composed of a series of little adventures, stitched together by the central plot thread of unlocking Cthulhu’s power. The Great Old One and his party just move from one location to another searching for hero-worthy activities. This almost episodic nature isn’t necessarily bad, but it left me without a sense of progression and accomplishment games with a tighter plot have.On its journey Cthulhu will find six companions: Umi the groupie, Sharpe the sword man, October the goth necromancer, Paws the alien cat, Dacre the senile healer, and Ember the dragon. There is also a secret boss who can join your party. Two secret characters couldn’t arrive in time for the photo shoot.Most of these characters are a light spin on genre tropes. They usually break the fourth wall by talking directly to the narrator or by commenting on gameplay elements. It’s possible interact with them through some awkward yet entertaining dialogues by selecting Chat on the Menu. Sometimes they will even give tips to the player.But how good is the humor?Initially, I must say I enjoy titles with a more lighthearted, humorous tone (like the Disgaea series). I think they are a nice change of pace from all these ultra-mature games we have nowadays. But regarding Cthulhu Saves the World, I can summarize it as hit or miss. Probably the humor was fresher in 2010, but now it felt contrived. I won’t deny that the game made me chuckle a lot and that it has some smart gag here and there, however only on a few stances I got a full laugh. I acknowledge humor is very subjective, so likely it wasn’t for me.PresentationGraphically the game is nothing outstanding, even for 16-bit standards. I sincerely thought the game was developed on some instance of RPG Maker, and I bet I wasn’t the only one. But the developers already explained that they designed a custom engine with Microsoft XNA and C.The game has a few cutscenes presented by a succession of static panels, similar to a digital comic book. It’s a well used and economical style. Unfortunately, the anime-inspired artwork looks amateurish. I don’t know if it was intentional or not, but the same artist also did the graphical art of Cosmic Star Heroine, which is a lot better.As for the soundtrack, it is great, I love it. It is available for free on the developers’ website, alongside the design document for the game. It’s a fine read for those interested in game design or curious about how the game changed while in development.MechanicsExploringFlying in the middle of nowhere.There isn’t much to say about the overworld of Cthulhu Saves the World. It feels empty, with a few cities and dungeons scattered around forests and mountains.Dungeons aren’t difficult to navigate, yet it’s common to backtrack because you reached a dead end. Some dungeons have puzzles, but they are very simple and won’t cause anyone a headache. As for cities, they are useful only for buying new equipment, for recovering MP at the local inn (the innkeepers always give you a free stay), and to find the plot’s reason to visit the next dungeon. NPCs won’t give side quests or tell interesting story information, but it’s worthy to lose some time reading their gag dialogues. Luckily, every time you enter a city it becomes available for teleportation.In the end, the game doesn’t offer anything by exploring its world, focusing its attention on fighting enemies and completing the plot.Battle SystemJust to be clearer, I played the game on the Insane difficulty, so other settings may give you a different experience.As expected from a title that emulates 16-bit JRPGs, you have to deal with a turn-based battle system and random encounters while investigating dungeons and the overworld. But the game also attenuates some of the genre’s problems with more contemporary ideas.To avoid irritating the player with the usual amount of never-ending random battles, dungeons have an encounter limit. As a result, enemies won’t appear anymore when it reaches zero. It’s a welcome mechanic when you lose your way or just wish to explore for finding treasure chests. If you still need more fights before the boss or just want to grind more, it’s possible to start one by selecting Fight on the Menu. I never ran out of enemies because all dungeons have a 9999-encounter limit on the Insane difficulty.Battles are quick, turn-based and have relatively deep mechanics. Only four characters can stay on the active party during combat, but thankfully everyone will gain equal amounts of XP. It’s a good feature since idle characters will always keep up with the active party. Therefore, it’s easier to experiment new formations because no one is under leveled.Visually, everything is simplistic. Your characters don’t appear on the screen, enemies don’t have animations and actions are represented by plain visual and sound effects, very reminiscent of early Dragon Quest titles. Enemies make references too!Besides the standard normal attack, characters can use techniques, spells or combined techniques by spending MP. It’s also possible to dodge to gain a boost in defense for the current turn and to attract enemy attacks. Techniques and spells are basically the same, there is no practical difference between them. As for Combined techniques, I only found the buffing and healing ones useful, since every character dealt more damage individually.During combat a combo counter is displayed on the upper left side of the screen. It will increase every time a character attack. Some techniques will increase in power the higher the counter is but they will reset it if used, so it’s a good strategy to keep increasing it until it’s possible to deliver a finishing blow. It’s great to kill a boss a few turns earlier.To spice up combat, every turn enemies will grow more powerful. Naturally, you need to kill them fast before they become too strong.To minimize the resource management and to make the random battles less exhausting, after winning a fight all characters will fully recover, regaining all their HP, recovering from status ailments and reviving if dead. They will also regain some MP, the only resource that still needs some care. There are healing spots near every boss room that will recover all the characters MP, leaving the party ready for the challenge ahead.Since the game is very generous with health, there are only two healing items: potions and 1-Ups. Potions are used during combat for reviving dead characters, healing status ailments and recovering HP, while a 1-Up lets you retry a battle when defeated, instead of getting a game over. Interestingly, this item that should be a life saver is somewhat useless because it’s possible to save your progress at any point, except during battles. Anyway, these items are found in chests on cities and dungeons and can’t be bought in stores.I enjoy how the developers handled the genre’s biggest complaints, but it’s possible to argue that this design choices may take away the challenge. I disagree, as the game still is tough enough without excessive grinding (I died a lot to common enemies). They only make battles faster and more fun, since now it’s possible to blast monsters with your most powerful attacks instead of holding back until the dungeon boss.Like is most RPGs, after acquiring enough experience your characters will gain levels. Surprisingly, you will be able to choose between two sets of attributes or between two different skills, depending on the level your character is. Just be aware that around level 40 you will stop receiving new skills and will be able to choose only between different attributes.ExtrasThere are a few game modes to try after beating the game: Cthulhu’s Angels, Score Attack, Highlander and Overkill. The most interesting is Cthulhu’s Angels because it offers a second quest with a somewhat original story, two new playable characters (three if you count a new secret boss) and never-before-seen enemies. The four heroines of Cthulhu’s Angels.On this new story, Cthulhu forms a team of four girls to perform heroic deeds in his place after his powers were sealed. Most of the game’s events are retraced, but some will play a little differently. October and Umi return as playable characters, however they are joined by two newcomers: Elona, the antagonist healer from the original story, and Molly, the Were-Zompire dimensional-traveler and main character from a visual novel made by one of the developers and released as an Xbox 360 indie title in 2009.I think it’s the only mode worthy playing after beating the game, more so if you enjoyed the humor and mechanics.Final thoughts Cthulhu Saves the World is a modern take on JRPGs. By modern I don’t mean that it got rid of older mechanics, on the contrary, the game made them more engaging and less burdensome for the player. It’s necessary to respect developers that, on a budget title, still think about ways to make a game more fun and less taxing.I must say I had lots of fun playing this title, even on the hardest difficulty. I admit I regretted this choice when common enemies frequently killed my party, but I persisted. Luckily, the game won’t let you lose too much progress since it’s possible to save scum or to use a 1-Up item when necessary.Random encounters weren’t excessive and battles ended fast, except for bosses. Those always gave me problems, but it was great to keep trying new characters and new strategies until they were defeated. Logically, sometimes it took some grinding to achieve victory, but since battles aren’t very lengthy and to start a new one you just need to select Fight on the menu, it was far away from the worst grind I ever did.The simple but lighthearted story and contrived humor can be a bit distracting, but for the most part they are harmless enough to keep you curious about what’s going to be thrown at the characters next.As the design document said, “as an indie title, you have to hook the player immediately.” With its humorous approach to characters and storytelling, improved JRPG mechanics, two main storylines, different difficulties, multiple modes unlocked after beating the game and a criminally cheap price (less than a dollar), Cthulhu Saves the World successfully accomplishes this goal and has a lot to offer.Final opinion: Very recommended. Notes on crashing: On Windows 10 (and windows 8), the game may crash after the opening cutscene. That’s a problem related to windows media player. You will need to install it on your system otherwise the game won’t run. These instructions are for Windows 10, but the steps are practically the same for Windows 8, with minor differences on the names of some options. How to install: Right-click on the Windows start button and click on Apps and Features. Click on Programs and Features (right side of the screen) and then click on Turn Windows features on or off. Search for Media Features on the new window and expand it by clicking on the “+”. Mark the box that says Windows Media Player and restart your computer. If Media Features can’t be expanded or doesn’t show a Windows Media Player option: On the Apps and Features screen click on Manage optional features and then on Add a feature. Find Windows Media Player and click on install. After the installation is completed, do the first set of steps to activate Windows Media Player and restart your machine. The game should be playable now. &amp;#8617; " }, { "title": "The Witcher — a bit of a letdown", "url": "/posts/The-Witcher-a-bit-of-a-letdown/", "categories": "Pc", "tags": "2007, witcher", "date": "2021-12-15 09:02:00 -0300", "snippet": " IntroductionIn hindsight, it’s easy to think about 2007 as one of gaming’s greatest years, thanks to titles like Bioshock, Assassin’s Creed, Mass Effect, Portal, Mario Galaxy, Uncharted, Halo 3 and many others. It was a rough year for developers, who had to fight for the consumers’ attention. Amidst all these great releases, CD Projekt Red, at the time an unknown Polish company that only worked on translating games, released their very first title, The Witcher. Nowadays the franchise is widely known even by the general public, but for a lot of people this game was their first contact with the series.The Witcher is an RPG originally released in October 2007, exclusively for PCs. It was inspired by The Witcher novels written by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. With “inspired” I meant that the game isn’t a straight adaptation of the books, but functions as a sequel to their story.It’s not mandatory to read the books to enjoy the game, as necessary information is always given to the player. But it’s neat to understand references to past events and to meet memorable characters from the novels.The game saw a rerelease in September 2008, as The Witcher Enhanced Edition. It featured a lot of fixes for bugs, loading times, animations, etc. It also came with a lot of collectible goods, like a map, a strategy guide, a making-of DVD, and the game’s soundtrack. This is the version being sold on digital stores nowadays. But let’s talk about the game’s content.The NarrativeLike the novels, The Witcher’s main character is Gerald of Rivia, an old, seasoned witcher. So, what is a witcher? To make matters simple, they are former humans artificially mutated to have superhuman reflexes, strength, speed, the capacity to see in the dark and a few other quirks. They kill evil creatures, lift curses and other similar activities for a fee.The game is unnecessary divided in seven parts (a prologue, five chapters and an epilogue), since it’s just a long, self-contained story. Most chapters bring a change of scenario, moving Gerald alongside backward villages, a swamp and the city of Vizima.As the game begins, Gerald’s friends find him confused and suffering from amnesia, after being presumably dead. Concerned, the other witchers bring him to their castle. During Gerald’s recovery, the game’s main antagonist, an organization called Salamandra, attacks the place, seeking out the mutagens used to create new witchers. The criminal group successfully steals them and it’s members flee through a portal. Kaer Morhen Thanks to this event, now Gerald must depart to recover the mutagens, discover the evil organization’s true objectives and find out who he is. On this journey he will find some political intrigue, ethical dilemmas and some quirky characters.As said before, the game is not an adaptation of the book series, but their sequel, as it begins a few years after the series last book, The Lady of the Lake. This was a clever idea since the developers didn’t become restricted by the books’ events.As Gerald is the only playable character, the game focus heavily on his experiences, personality and viewpoint, always trying to explore the differences and similarities between his past self, as remembered by his old acquaintances, and the person he’s now, made by the player’s choices and actions. That was an ingenious way to justify why a seasoned fighter must relearn the basics of sword-fighting and regain all his previous knowledge. It also makes characters reintroducing themselves less awkward.Overall, the game’s plot is very interesting and has a good length, offering many hours of gameplay even if you don’t do a lot of side quests. I spent a bit more than 60 hours, but I did many side quests — including collectathons — and explored a lot. Unfortunately, right at the end the story becomes too convoluted and devolves into a “we must save the world” kind of plot. Even if that was very disappointing, the game’s writing still is good, dealing with philosophical themes such as the nature of good and evil, the relativity of right and wrong, and prejudice. Vizima Taking in consideration how morality is important to the game’s plot and story, it comes as a surprise that there is no real morality system, a standard feature at the time. I see it as a positive aspect because instead of restricting the player into being good or evil, The Witcher only offers different paths based on your stance on the ethical dilemmas presented through the game. You’re not judged by the developers, you just move some parts of the story into a specific direction. But your decisions won’t cause a significant shift to the plot. Someone lives and someone else dies, one person will help you or will try to kill you.The game isn’t always serious, as it has a decent amount of humorous moments. One of my favorites is when a druid talks about protesting against animal cruelty (if I remember correctly, this joke was on one of the books also).Most side characters will offer interesting dialogues about philosophical themes or just funny banter to lighten the mood. Together with other NPCs they give a lively appearance to cities and villages. Some NPCs will offer to waste your time playing games like fighting in the inn, drinking in the inn or playing dices in the inn. Unfortunately, there isn’t a lot to see or do outside the city of Vizima, making the outdoor environments feel somewhat empty.You can also spice your playtime by “romancing” some ladies. After spending some quality time with them, you will earn a card with some beautiful artwork of your lover, very reminiscent of European comic books. Gotta catch ’em all, right? Interestingly, because the illustrations had some nudity were very provocative, the editions released in North America were censored had tamer drawings on the cards. Think about the children.MechanicsEven though the plot, dialogue and setting are good, The Witcher is not a book to be judged only by these elements. It’s a game, so its mechanics play an important role on judging its quality, even if it’s an RPG. It’s this aspect that pulls it down.The game has an interface that is reminiscent of old CRPGs from the 90s. Like in those old titles, sometimes the game feels a bit clunky, mainly when you have a lot of dead enemies and need to search their corpses for new items. Also, managing the inventory can become a chore. You will develop carpal tunnel syndrome if you only use the mouse to play, so please learn the keyboard commands.There are two main mechanics: a crafting system and the battle system.Alchemy: the crafting systemThrough Alchemy you can craft potions, blade coats and bombs. Potions have many different effects like healing, attack bonuses or seeing in the dark; blade coats make swords deal more damage; bombs cause damage or a negative condition to an enemy, like blindness or bleeding. To craft items, it’s necessary to acquire the item’s recipe and have the right ingredients on your inventory. It’s possible to acquire materials by skinning monsters, collecting herbs and by looking on places developers like to hide items (barrels, furniture, NPCs, etc.).Alchemy is a useful addition because instead of resorting to grinding levels, the player can always give the enemies a negative status, increase Gerald’s attributes, exploit weaknesses or just throw a bomb to cause damage. It’s fulfilling to win against stronger opponents just by efficiently planning a fight. However, the more your level grows, the less useful this mechanic becomes, since opponents will stop to be a threat. There is no need to keep crafting items that will give you an advantage, just attack the enemy until it’s dead. Ultimately, Alchemy is a powerful tool that later becomes an afterthought.Less importantly, it is also possible to craft armor and swords by visiting blacksmiths. Unfortunately, it isn’t necessary or helpful since most of these items are available from merchants, are given as part of the main story or are dropped by enemies.The Battle SystemThe Witcher has a real-time battle system that probably looked very good on paper, but the longer you play the more it feels without depth, repetitive, slow and tiresome.Figthing enemiesYou can attack, cast magic or use support and offensive items. There are no defensive commands or movements. Like on The Witcher books, Gerald has two swords: a metal one for human, elves and dwarfs, and one made of silver for monsters. If the wrong sword is used, Gerald will deal less damage to the enemy. For each sword there are three attack styles: Strong for bigger or armored guys, Fast for smaller or fast opponents, and Group when you need crowd control. By clicking at the right time on the enemy, attacks of the same type can be chained in longer sequences.There are also two special attacks, Special Blows and Coups de Grace. After a few upgrades, the player gains the ability to use Special Blows, which are stronger strikes executed by holding the attack mouse button until a bar fills up. But there is a drawback: these attacks drain endurance from Gerald. Coups the Grace are instant killing moves that are only useable against stunned or knocked down enemies.The Igni SignInitially, it’s fun to watch Gerald’s moves, but after some hours of compulsive mouse-clicking it becomes uninteresting, even tedious to click and observe the long animations when you need to fight unimportant battles. It’s also frustrating when an attack doesn’t complete because there is no space for the attack sequence to complete. It’s also hard to fight using the over-the-shoulder camera, since some enemies like to attack you from behind. In the end I mostly used stun attacks in order to deliver Coup de Graces to quickly finish fights.PresentationGraphically the game is fine compared to other games from 2007, even if some character models are very ugly. Zoltan Chivay Kalkstein I replayed some parts of the game with the mod “StixsworldHD’s HD-4K Experience” by StixsmasterHD. It uses ReShade and makes the graphics shine, as if someone lifted a fog from your eyes. If you look around, there are other mods for graphical upgrades, with new textures and character models to make it more visually appealing if that is a problem for you. Mod off Mod on The soundtrack is very atmospheric and fits the game’s tone and setting well, but I probably wouldn’t listen to it outside of the game. For those who enjoyed it more than I, a bit of bad news. When CD Projekt Red officially released it, they thought it was better to give us just 29 songs that actually are on the game and other 15 songs “inspired” by them, instead of releasing a full soundtrack. What a letdown.Final ThoughtsOn the storytelling front, The Witcher is a fine adaptation as it retains the book’s tone, colorful characters and some unusual moments. Unfortunately, even if its main storyline will keep you interested in its twists and turns, gameplay wise it isn’t very good due to its tiresome combat, some repetitive side quests and clunky interface. The game typically is very stable, and the worst bugs I found were related to events that didn’t trigger correctly. Loading from a previous save resolved the problem.Taking in consideration its usual price and how cheap it becomes during sales, if you can put up with the game’s problems The Witcher is a worthwhile experience even if you aren’t one of Gerald’s fans.Final opinion: Recommended for the franchise fans and for non-fans that can stand a tedious battle system to enjoy a good story." } ]
