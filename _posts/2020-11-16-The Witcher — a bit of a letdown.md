In hindsight, it’s easy to think about 2007 as one of gaming’s greatest years, thanks to titles like Bioshock, Assassin’s Creed, Mass Effect, Portal, Mario Galaxy, Uncharted, Halo 3 and many others. It was a rough year for developers, who had to fight for the consumers’ attention. Amidst all these great releases, CD Projekt Red, at the time an unknown Polish company that only worked on translating games, released their very first title, The Witcher. Nowadays the franchise is widely known even by the general public, but for a lot of people this game was their first contact with the series.
The Witcher is a CRPG inspired by The Witcher novels written by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. With “inspired” I meant that the game isn’t a straight adaptation of the books, but functions as a sequel to their story. This was a clever idea since the developers didn’t become restricted by the books’ plot, instead expanding it.

It’s not necessary to have read the novels to enjoy the game, but I admit it’s neat to understand a reference or to meet a memorable character.

Like the novels, The Witcher’s main character is Gerald of Rivia, an old, seasoned witcher. So, what is a witcher? To make matters simple, they are former humans artificially mutated to have superhuman reflexes, strength, speed, the capacity to see in the dark and a few other quirks. They kill evil creatures, lift curses and other similar activities for a fee. 

The game is divided in chapters (a prologue, five chapters and an epilogue), what is unnecessary, since the game it’s just a long, self-contained story.

The game begins a few years after the last book, The Lady of the Lake. During the Prologue Gerald is found by his friends in an amnesiac state. Confused, he’s brought to the witcher’s base to be treated. During his recovery, the game’s main antagonist, an organization called Salamandra, attacks the fortress. The group successfully steals the mutagens used to create new witchers and flee through a portal. Now Gerald must recover the mutagens, discover the evil organization’s true objectives and find out who he is. On this journey you will find some political intrigue, ethical dilemmas and some quirky characters.

As Gerald is the only playable character, the game focus heavily on his personality and viewpoint, always trying to explore the differences and similarities between his past self, as remembered by his old acquaintances, and the person he’s now, made by the player’s choices and actions. That was an ingenious way to justify why a seasoned fighter must relearn the basics of sword-fighting and regain all his previous knowledge. It also makes characters reintroducing themselves less awkward.

Overall, the game’s plot is very interesting and has a good length, offering many hours of gameplay even if you don’t do a lot of side quests. I spent a bit more than 60 hours, but I did many side quests — including collectathons — and explored a lot. Unfortunately, the story becomes too convoluted and the plot devolves into another “we must save the world” story at the end of the game. Even if that was very disappointing, the game’s writing still is good, dealing with philosophical themes such as the nature of good and evil, the relativity of right and wrong, and prejudice. 

Taking in consideration how morality is important to the game’s plot and story, it comes as a surprise that there is no real morality system, a standard feature at the time. I see it as a positive aspect because instead of restricting the player into being good or evil, The Witcher only offers different paths based on your stance on the ethical dilemmas presented through the game. You’re not judged by the developers, you just move some parts of the story into a specific direction. But your decisions won’t cause a significant shift to the plot. Someone lives and someone else dies, one person will help you or will try to kill you.

The game isn’t always serious, as it has a decent amount of humorous moments. One of my favorites is when a druid talk about protesting against animal cruelty (if I remember correctly, this joke was on one of the books also).

Most side characters will offer interesting dialogues about philosophical themes or just funny banter to lighten the mood. Together with other NPCs they give a lively appearance to cities and villages. Some NPCs will offer to waste your time playing games like fighting in the inn, drinking in the inn or playing dices in the inn. Unfortunately, there isn’t a lot to see or do outside the city of Vizima, making the outdoor environments feel somewhat empty. 

You can also spice your playtime by “romancing” some ladies. After spending some quality time with them, you will earn a card with some beautiful artwork of your lover, very reminiscent of European comic books. Gotta catch ’em all, right? Because the illustrations are very “provocative”, North America’s cards were tamer during the game’s first release. Think about the children.

## Presentation

Graphically the game is fine compared to other games from 2007, except for some ugly character models. I replayed some parts of the game with the mod “StixsworldHD’s HD-4K Experience” by StixsmasterHD. It uses ReShade and makes the graphics shine, as if someone lifted a fog from your eyes. If you look around, there are other mods for graphical upgrades, with new textures and character models to make it more visually appealing if that is a problem for you.
 
The soundtrack is very atmospheric and fits the game’s tone and setting well, but I probably wouldn’t listen to it without playing the game. For those who enjoyed it more, a bit of bad news. When CD Projekt Red officially released it, they thought it was better to give us just 29 songs that actually are on the game and other 15 songs “inspired” by them, instead of releasing a full soundtrack. What a letdown.
 

## Mechanics

 Even though The Witcher’s plot, dialogue and setting are good, it’s not a book to be judged only by these elements. It’s a game, so its mechanics play an important role on judging its quality, even for RPGs. It’s this aspect that pulls it down. The game has two main mechanics: alchemy, a crafting system, and the battle system.
 
Through Alchemy you can craft potions, blade coats and bombs. Potions have many different effects like healing, attack bonuses or seeing in the dark; blade coats make swords deal more damage; bombs cause damage or a negative condition to an enemy, like blindness or bleeding. To craft items, it’s necessary to acquire the item’s recipe and have the right materials on your inventory.
 
Alchemy is a useful addition because instead of resorting to grinding levels, the player can always give the enemies a negative status, increase Gerald’s attributes, exploit weaknesses or just throw a bomb to cause damage. It’s fulfilling to win against stronger opponents just by efficiently planning a fight. However, the more your level grows, the less useful this mechanic becomes, since opponents will stop to be a threat. There is no need to keep crafting items that will give you an advantage, just attack the enemy until it’s dead. Ultimately, Alchemy is a powerful tool that later becomes an afterthought.
 
It’s also possible to craft armor and swords by visiting blacksmiths. Unfortunately, it isn’t necessary or helpful since most of them are available from merchants, are given as part of the main story or are dropped by enemies.
 

## Battle System

 
The Witcher has a real-time battle system that probably looked very good on paper, but the longer you play the more it feels repetitive, slow and tiresome. You can attack, cast magic or use support and offensive items. Like on the witcher books, Gerald has two swords: a metal one for human, elves and dwarfs, and one made of silver for monsters. If used against the incorrect foe, you will deal less damage. For each sword there are three attack styles: Heavy for bigger guys, Fast for quick opponents, and Group for crowd control. Attacks of the same type can be chained in longer sequences by clicking at the right time on the enemy. 
 
Initially, it’s fun to watch Gerald’s moves, but after some hours of compulsive mouse-clicking it becomes uninteresting, even tedious to click and observe the long animations when you need to fight common enemies. It’s also frustrating when an attack doesn’t complete because there is no space for the attack sequence to complete. Other annoying situation is when Gerald blocks your view of an enemy while pirouetting, canceling your combo.
 
Magic feels like an afterthought, since most spells (called signs in the game) aren’t useful outside combat neither are visually interesting to watch. You will also never find an enemy that requires it to be killed. There are only five signs, but only two are useful: Aard, the wind sign (it can stun most enemies), and Igni, the fire sign (it can cause a lot of damage if upgraded enough). I mostly used a combination of attacks, crafted items and these two signs during my time playing.

## Final Thoughts

The Witcher is a fine adaptation as it retains the book’s tone, colorful characters and some unusual moments. Unfortunately, even if its main storyline will keep you interested in its twists and turns, gameplay wise it isn’t very good due to its tiresome combat and some repetitive side quests. The game typically is very stable, and the worst bugs I found were related to  events that didn’t trigger correctly. Loading from a previous save resolved the problem.

Taking in consideration its usual price and how cheap it becomes during sales, if you can put up with the game’s problems I think it’s a worthwhile experience even if you aren’t a witcher fan.

**Final opinion:** Recommended for the franchise fans and for non-fans that don’t mind a tedious battle system coupled with a good story.
